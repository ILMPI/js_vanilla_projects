# Calculator
 1. create a basic math
 2. functions
 3. create UI
 4. render results
 
 Step 1: Define the User Interface with HTML

    Main Idea: Construct the layout for the calculator, which includes a display area for showing results and buttons for the digits, operations, and an equals button.
    Hint: Use <div> elements to organize the layout. Create a separate <div> for the display and another for the buttons. Each button can be an <button> element.

Step 2: Style the User Interface with CSS

    Main Idea: Make the calculator visually appealing and ensure the buttons and display are comfortably sized and clearly visible.
    Hint: Use CSS to style the <div> containing the calculator. Define styles for the buttons (<button>) like background color, border, and font size. Consider adding :hover effects to improve interactivity.

Step 3: Implement the Functions with JavaScript

    Main Idea: Write JavaScript to handle the logic of the calculator. This includes capturing user inputs, performing mathematical operations, and updating the display.
    Hint: Attach onclick events to each button to capture user actions. Use a variable to keep track of the input entered and another to store the current operation. For operations, consider using the eval() function, but be aware of its risks and limitations.

Step 4: Render Results

    Main Idea: Ensure that the results of the calculations are properly displayed on the calculator's screen.
    Hint: Update the content of the display <div> dynamically based on the user's interactions and the results of calculations.

Additional Explanations and Algorithms:

    Handling User Input: Every time a button is clicked, update a string variable that keeps track of everything the user has entered. This includes numbers and operators.
    Calculating Results: When the equals button is pressed, parse the string of inputs to calculate the result. This could be done using a straightforward evaluation of the string if itâ€™s correctly formatted.
    Updating the Display: After any input or calculation, the display needs to be updated to reflect the current value of the input string or the result of the calculation.
    Clearing the Calculator: Implement a clear functionality that resets the input string and updates the display to show a default value like zero.

This approach will help you build a functional and visually appealing calculator, sticking solely to the basics of web development without any additional libraries or frameworks.
